_How did you prioritize your time? What did you work on?_
I prioritized working on the todo-list fuctionality:
-Ability for users to create todo-list
-Ability for users to update a specific todo
-Ability for users to delete a specific todo
-Ability for users to check a specific todo once completed
I created three different components to achieve all this:

1. Todo.js: this is the component that maps through the list of todos and displays them
2. TodoForms.js: this component contains the form that allows users create a todo.
3. TodoList.js: this component serves as the parent component to the others, it also contains the functions that allows users add, update, delete, and check a specific todo once completed

_What decision points did you come to, especially on the technical side? How did you reach the decision you did? Are there any questions you would have asked if you could?_
I decided to create a form that allows users to create a list of todos and i made use of CSS to customize each todo. I came to this decision because i believe users should be able to create a list of todos for a particular call session seamlessly, and it should be visible across all other users on the same call in real time.

_What would you do in this scenario if there was more time? What would come next? Is there anything you would change if you could do it again?_
Unfortunately i had limited time to work on this project as i have other tasks to attend to, so i wasn't able to complete the real time sync functionality. If given more time i would definitly get it to work fine. I would also work on customizing how a users status would be seen be other users on the same call.
